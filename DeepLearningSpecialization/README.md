#### Project IV-1: [Build Multi-perceptron Neural Networks Step by Step and Apply to Classify Cat and Non-cat Images](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/tree/master/DeepLearningSpecialization/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)

The project consists of two parts: First - [Build a neural networks model from scratch](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/DeepLearningSpecialization/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step/Building%2Byour%2BNN%2BStep%2Bv8.ipynb), and Second - [Apply to classify cat and non-cat images](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/DeepLearningSpecialization/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week%204/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20Application%20Image%20Classification/Deep%2BNN%2BApp%2Bv8.ipynb)

Dataset: [Cat and non-cat images with labels stored in h5 format](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/tree/master/DeepLearningSpecialization/datasets) - The dataset has been splitted to a train dataset and a test dataset.

Project steps brief summary: 
* Scratch weight and bias initialization function, forward propagation functions, cost function, backward propagation functions, and optimization function.
* Apply the scratched functions to build a multi-perceptron neural networks model to classify cat and non-cat images. `hidden_layer = 2`. One is with relu activation function, and the other is with sigmoid activation function.
