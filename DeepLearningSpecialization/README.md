#### Project IV-1: [Build Multi-perceptron Neural Networks Step by Step and Apply to Classify Cat and Non-cat Images](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/tree/master/DeepLearningSpecialization/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)

The project consists of two parts: First - [Build a neural networks model from scratch](), and Second - [Apply to classify cat and non-cat images]() to train models with Boston Housing dataset in order to make prediction of prices for clients who intend to purchase houses.
Dataset: Boston Housing Prices and Features (e.g. numbers of rooms, student-to-teacher ratios, etc.) from Kaggle
