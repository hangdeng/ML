## The project uses supervised learning algorithms to train models with Boston Housing dataset in order to make prediction of prices for clients who intend to purchase houses.
### Dataset: Boston Housing Prices and Features (e.g. numbers of rooms, student-to-teacher ratios, etc.) from Kaggle
#### Project steps brief summary: 
1) Load Dataset
2) Training and testing data splitting
3) Train model using DecisionTreeRegressor
4) Evaluate the model with GridSearchCV cross validation
5) Make prediction
6) Justify if more features should be included.
