# ML

ML scripts in Python Jupyter notebook
## (1) Boston_housing: ##
The project uses supervised learning algorithms to train models with Boston Housing dataset in order to make prediction of prices for clients who intend to purchase houses.
Dataset: Boston Housing Prices and Features (e.g. numbers of rooms, student-to-teacher ratios, etc.) from Kaggle
Project steps brief summary: 
1) Load Dataset
2) Training and testing data splitting
3) Train model using DecisionTreeRegressor
4) Evaluate the model with GridSearchCV cross validation
5) Make prediction
6) Justify if more features should be included.


## (2) Find_donors: ##
This project evaluate three classifiers (e.g. SVC, Statistical Gradient Descent classifier, essemble methods-adaboost, logistic regression, etc.) by training the models with training data and computing accuracy_score and f0.5_score for model performance on training data and testing data. The best model is selected based on computing time, and model performance.
