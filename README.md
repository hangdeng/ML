Machine learning scripts in Python Jupyter notebook

### Project I: 1) [Boston_housing](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/boston_housing.ipynb): ###
------
The project uses supervised learning algorithms to train models with Boston Housing dataset in order to make prediction of prices for clients who intend to purchase houses.
Dataset: Boston Housing Prices and Features (e.g. numbers of rooms, student-to-teacher ratios, etc.) from Kaggle
Project steps brief summary: 
* Load Dataset
* Training and testing data splitting
* Train model using DecisionTreeRegressor
* Evaluate the model with GridSearchCV cross validation
* Make prediction
* Justify if more features should be included.


### Project I: 2) [Find_donors](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/finding_donors.ipynb): ###
------
Project steps:
* Evaluate three classifiers (e.g. SVC, Statistical Gradient Descent classifier, essemble methods-adaboost, logistic regression, etc.) by training the models with training data and computing accuracy_score and f0.5_score for model performance on training data and testing data. 
* The best model is selected based on computing time, and model performance (accuracy_score, f0.5_score). 
* After best model selected, GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization. 

### Project I: 3) [Create_customer_segments](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/customer_segments.ipynb): ###
------
Project brief summary:
- Unsupervised learning problem (e.g. hierarchical clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, complete- and average-link clustering, etc.)
- Project steps:
* Data Preprocessing: log transform, outlier detection (points falling out of 1.5 IQR and reasonably remove a few)
* PCA: dimensionality reduction.
* Clustering: K-Means v.s. GaussianMixture Model; use of Silhouette score as evaluation metrics.
* Visualizaton, Prediction: pca.inverse_transform for centers of clusters, predict selected samples and compare with raw data.
