#### Project III-1 [Bike sharing prediction with simple neural nets](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/DeepLearning-Practical-Projects/Project-Bike_sharing/Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb):

Datasets: included in the folder.

Project brief summary:
* Data processing: train, validation, and test data splitting, change to dummy variables, scale variables
* Neural networks: The neural networks in this project have three layers: input layer, hidden layer (`hidden_nodes = 14`) and output layer. It uses forward pass and backpropogation to model and update weights for finding the best model.
* Model performance: model predictability is tested with test data.

#### Project III-2 [Dog breed classification with Convolutional Neural Nets](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/tree/master/DeepLearning-Practical-Projects/project-dog-classification):

Datasets: Due to the data size limit, the dog dataset can be downloaded from [dog_data](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). The dataset shall be saved as `folder_path\dogImages`. The human dataset can be downloaded from [human_data](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). The unzipped folder shall be saved as `folder_path\lfw`.
