# DL Practical Projects

### Project 3.1) [Bike_sharing prediction with simple neural nets](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/blob/master/DeepLearning-Practical-Projects/Project-Bike_sharing/Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb)

------

Project brief summary:
* Data processing: train, validation, and test data splitting, change to dummy variables, scale variables
* Neural networks: The neural networks in this project have three layers: input layer, hidden layer (`hidden_nodes = 14`) and output layer. It uses forward pass and backpropogation to model and update weights for finding the best model.
* Model performance: model predictability is tested with test data.

### Project 3.2) [Dog_breed_classification with Convolutional Neural Nets](https://github.com/hangdeng/MachineLearningToDeepLearning-Practical-Projects/tree/master/DeepLearning-Practical-Projects/project-dog-classification)
